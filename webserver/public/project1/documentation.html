    <p style="width: 100%;text-align: left; text-indent: 5vw;">When conceptualizing the project, I assessed my skill level and realized that 
        I couldn't do a lot of content that required JavaScript. 
        I looked at the HTML tutorials Sam provided on his GitHub page. 
        In addition, I found a web tutorial on HTML and CSS from the video site bilibili: <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Wr4y1R7Bd/?spm_id_from=333.880.my_history.page.click&vd_source=80104d07741f4dbaaef5064abb77e045" style="color: aquamarine;">HERE</a> , 
        which I followed to learn a lot about web development and HTML and CSS code.</p>
    <p style="width: 100%;text-align: left; text-indent: 5vw;">Then, I started to create my own website. Firstly, I want it to have a header, an intriguing title, and my self-intro. Also, I checked <a href="https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/using_type/using_web_fonts" style="color: aquamarine;">HERE</a> 
    as a reference to get my web font. Thanks Google!</p>
    <img src="docuImg/1.png" alt="1" style="width: 50%">
    <p style="width: 100%;text-align: left; text-indent: 5vw;">I setup the header, the mainpage(I used photoshop to edit that for complicated layout), the hypertext links, and used CSS to give them formats.</p>
    <p style="width: 100%;text-align: left; text-indent: 5vw;">Then I worked on the About page. I found several photos and uploaded them on the site. Then, I used CSS for layout, which was time-consuming. I also searched up about how to keep the aspect ratio of imgs when cutting them by CSS: <a href="https://blog.csdn.net/rubys007/article/details/136486937" style="color:aquamarine ;">HERE</a></p>
    <img src="docuImg/2.png" alt="2" style="width: 50%">
    <p style="width: 100%;text-align: left; text-indent: 5vw;">Then, I investigated how to use iframe to embed webpage inside my own webpage: <a href="https://blog.csdn.net/qq_40697172/article/details/106865583" style="color: aquamarine;">HERE</a> because I have several public website projects and a Cargo portfolio site. I wanted to utilize them. Then, I edited the layouts, which was really complicated.</p>
    <img src="docuImg/3.png" alt="3" style="width: 50%;">
    <p style="width: 100%;text-align: left; text-indent: 5vw;">At last, I developed a template for images layout and edited my Interest webpage. It was convenient after the template developed but the progress is hard.</p>
